My name is **Aurélien Nicosia**.  
I am a lecturer in mathematics and statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Université Laval (Québec). I am also the coordinator of the [Center for Tutoring and Learning (CDA)](https://www.fsg.ulaval.ca/departements/departement-de-mathematiques-et-de-statistique/etudier/centre-de-depannage-et-dapprentissage), a student support space where students receive help each term.

My work sits at the intersection of university pedagogy, applied statistics, and the development of digital tools for teaching and research.  
I place strong emphasis on reproducibility, open science, and knowledge accessibility.
