## Teaching philosophy

I approach teaching mathematics, statistics, and data science as a process of **understanding and exploration**.  
Learning is based on three principles:

- **Learning by doing**: practice and hands-on use of tools like R or Quarto help students build meaning.  
- **Learning through collaboration**: team projects and discussion are central in my courses.  
- **Transparent learning**: every activity is documented and reproducible, embedding scientific rigor in student work.

I rely on project-based learning, formative assessment, and a supportive environment where rigor and curiosity can coexist.
