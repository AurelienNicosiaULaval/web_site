## Vision
  
I see pedagogical innovation as a **lever for transforming learning**.  
My goal is to design environments where students become active participants in their own training through active approaches, modern digital tools, and a culture of reproducibility.

My projects are organized around three axes:

1. **Modernizing courses** with open technologies (R, Quarto, Learnr, GitHub).  
2. **Support and supervision** through teaching assistant training and collaborative resource development.  
3. **Responsible integration of artificial intelligence** in teaching and student support.

  > 🌱 For me, pedagogical innovation means connecting rigor, creativity, and accessibility so each student can learn through exploration, experimentation, and understanding.
  
## Key projects
  
### Redesign of data science courses
Complete renewal of introductory data science and scientific programming courses.  
Objectives:

- make learning more active and contextualized;  
- develop francophone case studies;  
- provide automated formative feedback through Quarto and GitHub Classroom.

**Outcome:** improved motivation and student participation, while strengthening code reproducibility.


  
### Improving student success support
Development of a structured training model for teaching assistants and an internal platform combining resources, short videos, and FAQs.  
**Outcome:** professionalization of assistant roles and more consistent pedagogical support.
