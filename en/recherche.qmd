## Overview

My work sits at the interface of applied mathematics, computational statistics, and data science.  
I develop robust and interpretable methods for complex data analysis, with a special focus on reproducibility, open-source software, and practical translation into usable tools.



## Research axes

### 1. Density estimation and anomaly detection
I develop methods based on GLBFP (Generalized Linear Blend Frequency Polygons) that unify histograms, ASH, and LBFP.  
The goals are stability, adaptivity, and clear geometric interpretation.  
Direct application: detecting outliers through combinations of local densities.  
Software: GLBFP (R package, GitHub repository).

### 2. Directional statistics and angular models
Models for circular and directional data and random circular effects.  
Applications include orientation/movement, periodic phenomena, and dominant wind patterns.  
Software: CircularRegression (R package, GitHub repository).

### 3. Hidden models and latent dynamics
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models for temporal and spatio-temporal data.  
Recent interests include temporal-scale effects on inference, multi-individual models, and links with habitat-selection functions to connect behavior and environment.

### 4. Applied data science and pedagogical innovation
Transfer of statistical concepts to machine learning (measurement errors, interpretability, robustness).  
Development of open resources for data science training (Quarto, learnr, GitHub) and reflection on responsible AI use in education.
