## Interests and explorations

Beyond research and teaching, several areas feed my curiosity and projects.  
I enjoy exploring the boundaries between mathematics, art, data, and digital creativity.



### Mathematics, art, and visualization
I am interested in mathematical beauty in all its forms — whether an elegant equation, a well-designed visualization, or a random-generated motif.  
This curiosity has led me to projects at the boundary between art and data science, such as:

- 🎨 *Digital drawing with R*: exploring textures and generative patterns from probability laws.  
- 📐 *Mathematical recipes*: a writing project where each mathematical concept is presented as a “recipe,” blending rigor and poetry.  
📘 [View a sample of two mathematical recipes (PDF)](../Example Recipes.pdf) on Euler's identity ($e^{i\pi}+1 = 0$) and the Fibonacci sequence


### Writing and outreach

I like to make mathematics **accessible, alive, and inspiring**.  
My writing projects often combine storytelling, visual clarity, and conceptual rigor.  
I am currently working on:

- *Data Kitchen* — a learning platform inspired by the culinary world  

- *Mathematical Recipes* — an illustrated book to discover the beauty of theorems through short, visual "recipes"  



> 🌱 My path is guided by a simple idea:  
**bringing scientific rigor and human creativity together**,  
so mathematics and data science become spaces for discovery, art, and communication.
